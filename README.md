Boiler plate for p5.play
It is with great pleasure that i announce my new dish - The Lobster de la Sea! It is (like me) of French Origin. Its is essentially a regular lobster, but with a twist. Firstly, bring the water to a rolling boil. Grasp the live lobster from the back drop it headfirst into the boiling water. Cover the pot and once the water has started to boil again, start timing. Boil the lobster for 10 minutes for the first 1 pound of weight and then 3 more minutes for each extra pound.

  1.  In order to boil your lobster, you will need a large pot with a lid.
  2. Pour enough water in the pot to cover the lobster completely.
  3. Add 2 tablespoons of sea salt for every 2 liters (4 pints) of water.
  4. Bring the water to a rolling boil.
  5. Grasp the live lobster from the back drop it headfirst into the boiling water.
  6. Cover the pot and once the water has started to boil again, start timing.
  7. Once cooked, drain the lobster immediatlely.

  Between steps 1 and 2, add 1 Teaspoon of my special sauce for every litre of water you use.

  When cooked, serve with a side of pineapple, some lettuce, melted butter on the lobster for dripping and flavour.

  Voila! you have now made your Lobster de la Sea!
